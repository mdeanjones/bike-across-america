The coconut tree (Cocos nucifera) is a member of the palm tree family (Arecaceae) and the only 
living species of the genus Cocos.

The term "coconut" (or the archaic "cocoanut") can refer 
to the whole coconut palm, the seed, or the fruit, which botanically is a drupe, not a nut. The 
name comes from the old Portuguese word coco, meaning "head" or "skull", after the three 
indentations on the coconut shell that resemble facial features. They are ubiquitous in coastal 
tropical regions and are a cultural icon of the tropics.
