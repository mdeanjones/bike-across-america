The pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically 
significant plant in the family Bromeliaceae. The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it
has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple to Europe in the 17th century 
made it a significant cultural icon of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in 
greenhouses and many tropical plantations.

Pineapples grow as a small shrub; the individual flowers of the unpollinated plant fuse to form a multiple 
fruit. The plant is normally propagated from the offset produced at the top of the fruit, or from a side 
shoot, and typically mature within a year.
