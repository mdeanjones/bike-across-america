    <p class="flex-fill">At some point, after becoming an adult when this kind of thing became an actual possibility, I realized I
      now have a <i>job</i> and </i>responsibilities</i> that don't typically include multiple consecutive months
      of free time. I realized that the perfect time for a trip like this wouldn't come along on its own, and if I
      wanted to ever actually do it, I had to actually </i>do</i> it and </i>make</i> the time for it. So here we
      are! After many months of talking about it (and not nearly as much time preparing for this as you would expect)
      it's time to go!</p>

    <p class="flex-fill">For this ride, I will be riding the bicycle my mother rode cross-country back in 1984 - a 1974 Raleigh Super
      Course. You might be thinking <i>"oh Julie's mom must be so happy that she's riding her bike!"</i> In which case you
      would be wrong. She would prefer I ride a "modern bike" that's "safer". But my dad thinks it's a grand idea! And
      since he's the weird bicycle guy in an objectively weird bicycle family, that is a good enough endorsement for me.</p>

    <p class="flex-fill">I can't imagine talking about my love of bicycling without mentioning the bike I <i>won't</i>
      be riding: my beloved Brompton. I could wax poetic about the beauty of Brompton bicycles endlessly. But I
      won't. Instead, I'll just say this: when you have a bicycle that you can take anywhere, your whole world opens
      up in beautiful and unexpected ways.</p>
