We got a late start today leaving Mineral. A note to future Julie for future bicycle touring trips: it is never worth it to stick around at a BnB for breakfast. It’s always just so much later than we want breakfast. We didn’t start riding today until nearly 1000. 

The ride itself was good. More country roads, but certainly not the shortest route between Mineral and Richmond (which is typical for the meandering TransAm). We rode past Lake Anna and crossed a number of bridges, so the scenery was enjoyable.  I was in a hurry to get to Richmond so we kept a brisk pace and didn’t stop for lunch. 

My brother lives in Richmond and cycled out to meet us and ride with us to his house. He showed us a really nice route across a scenic bridge and along some quiet roads along the river. 

We went to a really cool brewery tonight. Great beer, good atmosphere. 

#### Highlights
- my dad put my bike up on his bike stand this morning and looked it over. He brought all his tools with him. Both of my derailleurs have been strong willed and troublesome the whole trip, so he worked on them both. When I first started riding I thought it had actually gotten worse. My bike hasn’t quietly changed gears this entire trip. If I’m trying to change gears and my bike isn’t loudly protesting it’s because it isn’t doing anything. Until today! It was so quiet and effortless I couldn’t even tell it was changing gears. Smooth like butter. Another note for future Julie: consider having your mechanic visit earlier in the trip.  
- seeing my brother and his family, which includes two babies and a dog 
- Mike and I ordered dinner from a vegan place that specializes in Philly cheesesteaks. They do one thing and do it really well. 
- really good beer at The Veil brewery. 

#### Lowlights
- waiting around all morning for breakfast and then not having much suitable for the vegans.
