Today we biked from Eureka, Nevada to Ely, Nevada. It was our longest day so far, distance-wise, and up there among the most climbing. Even still, I felt strong rolling into Ely. 

I started this morning with my first flat. Mike pumps up my tires every day (lovely man that he is) and he suspected I had a slow leak in the front tube. My rear tire would lose between 5 and 10 pounds of pressure each day and my front was losing between 30 and 50. This morning it was _really_ low so we just swapped the tube. The hypothesis is that there was a problem with the stem in the old tube. It was a bit crooked. 

Our ride had two smaller climbs and then two longer climbs, and then we _should have_ rolled into Ely on a 15 mile descent, but we had a headwind and had to pedal. Even more! After 60 miles! On a downhill!

Cycling through downtown Ely on the main street (route 50) was nice. It felt very old-timey. If it weren’t for all the strip bars, casinos, and 24/7 massage parlors, it would have felt downright wholesome. 

Once we checked in to the AirBnB, Mike and I walked to a local sports store to buy more tubes and waterproof cycling gloves. The sports store was _heavily_ geared towards hunting. They sold LOTS of guns and camo. I _almost_ had to buy camo cycling gloves. The deer would never see me coming! They also sold a t-shirt that said “vegetarians, my food poops on your food”. It’s funny, because eating plants is silly. 

We went to dinner at a Mexican restaurant in a casino. Then we played a few games in the casino. We bet $10 and left with $40, so not too bad!

#### Highlights
- Felt very strong after a long ride with lots of climbing
- Ended the day with margaritas and winning money at the casino
- We expected to be rained on again. The forecast called for scattered storms the whole day, but we missed all the rain.

#### Lowlights
- Flat tire was a bummer, but I’m glad we noticed before we left camp.
