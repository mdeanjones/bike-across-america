Today we drove back to San Francisco so that Mike could pick up a camper van. We didn't expect it, but it was kind of like revisiting the greatest hits of our journey so far. "_Hey, look! That's where Mike got his second flat tire!_" And: "_remember when we thought that hill was steep?!_"

After we got back to South Lake Tahoe, Jordan, Kelly, and I hopped back on our bikes and rode to Carson City, Nevada. We're so glad to be out of California! Just when we gained enough altitude that the weather was bearable, the smoke from nearby wildfires made it not recommended to "be outside" or "do anything strenuous." 

#### Highlights
- The new SAG wagon Mike picked up is really cool! Will make the next leg of the journey much easier, because services will be very limited. 
- We had a very long descent into Carson City - probably our longest yet

#### Lowlights
- Spent a lot of time in the car
- Riding on 50 was not so great. Intermittent shoulder, lots of cars. We'll be on 50 for quite a long time, but we expect the profile to change. 

#### Julie's food
- Breakfast: breakfast baps with "sausage"
- First Snack: hummus and crackers
- Lunch: kind of gross sandwich from Whole Foods
- Second Snack: power bar 
- Dinner: a similarly gross but different sandwich from Whole Foods

#### Stats
- Total distance: 32.20 miles
- Elevation gain: 1533 feet
- Weather: hot and dry, high of 88 degrees Fahrenheit, with lots of smoke from a wildfire west of here
