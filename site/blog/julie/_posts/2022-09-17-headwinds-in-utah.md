We made it to Cedar City, Utah today. We battled intense headwinds the whole way. The last 32 miles were really a struggle. It was a real bummer because today was supposed to be a nice, easy ride with just one gradual climb and mostly downhill otherwise. 

I spent the whole ride trying to pump myself up by thinking “at least it’s not raining” and “at least it’s not cold” and “it could be cold _and_ raining _and_ with this headwind.” It didn’t really help much. 

We have not yet decided what we are going to do tomorrow. We have a ~5,500 foot climb next and the headwinds are supposed to be even worse tomorrow, and bad all week. Maybe we’ll take a day off? And battle the climb/headwinds on fresher legs? 

#### Highlights
- Mike and I stopped at a coffee shop when we went through Milford this morning. After several days (weeks?) of instant coffee, a vanilla latte was amazing. 
- We had Indian food for dinner in Cedar City and it was very good 

#### Lowlights
- the headwind today was so bad I had to PEDAL while going DOWNHILL in a gear I used yesterday for climbing
- if I didn’t pedal while going downhill, the headwind was so strong I wouldn’t have been able to move fast enough for my bicycle to remain upright.
