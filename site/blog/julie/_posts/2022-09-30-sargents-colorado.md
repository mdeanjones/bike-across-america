Today we cycled to Sargents, Colorado. It is an unincorporated town (with a post office!) that has a permanent population of “21 hearty souls”. We are spending the night at Tomichi Creek Trading Post, which appears to be the only business in Sargents. It is a restaurant, gas station, general store, campground, RV park, gift shop, and they have cabin rentals. Nothing like taking a shower in the back of a restaurant. 

We had a very nice ride today. 60 miles and “mostly flat”, according to Google (which we have found cannot be trusted with elevation, but was accurate enough today). 

We biked along the Blue Mesa Reservoir for several miles this morning and spent much of the rest of the ride along a river feeding into the reservoir. We also passed lots of farms with horses and cows. 

#### Highlights
- we stopped for lunch in Gunnison. It was a very cute town. Mike and I went to a coffee shop we found on Happy Cow. We had a decent sweet potato breakfast burrito and two excellent pesto bagel sandwiches. 
- good views, good weather, easy ride
- our campsite overlooks a stream and a field of cows

#### Lowlights
- there was a guy at the campground who was slicing up a deer, just out in the open, outside his RV. In full view of _everyone_. It was like that scene in Game of Thrones with Tywin Lannister. Absolutely brutal.
