Today was an unexpectedly good day. It looked like we were going to get rained on all day, but really it only rained for the first 30 minutes or so of our ride.

We’re in Troutville tonight. We had to choose between riding the TransAm (roughly 50 miles) or going a more direct route (roughly 30 miles). We picked the TransAm, and I’m glad we did. We were on quiet country roads all day, riding past picturesque mountains and fields, with low hanging clouds adding to the scene. 

All four of us went to a tap house in Daleville for lunch, just outside of Troutville. Good beer, good food.
