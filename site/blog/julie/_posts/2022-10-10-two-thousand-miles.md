We have done more than 2,000 miles! When Mike built this website, he set up a way to check-in our location and then it automatically estimates our mileage traveled by querying the Google Maps API for cycling directions from our last check-in. We’ve found that it’s a decent estimate, but often uses a shorter route than we actually took. Today the estimated total distance traveled crossed the 2,000 mile mark, so we’ve definitely traveled more than that!

We had a great ride today. Perfect weather, few cars, decently paved roads. Mike and I stopped in the town of Buhler for lunch. We rode down Main Street, stopped at the local grocery store, and then had a picnic in the park. I love looking at the store fronts in all the small towns we go through. Unlike where we live, it looks like most stores are locally-owned and not part of a chain. It’s great to see. It makes where we live seem like a soulless hellscape of consumption. 

A little ways down the road from Buhler we passed signs for two different Mennonite churches. They couldn’t have been more than a half mile apart. I … didn’t know there were Mennonites in Kansas. 

We’re in Newton tonight. This is a proper city. It has _multiple_ large grocery stores. Kansas has been great in that we can ride from one town with a grocery store to another town with a grocery store in the same day, and don’t have to plan ahead like we needed to do further West. 
 

#### Highlights
- I saw something that looked like a tiny cyclone. The wind was blowing in a cyclone shape and had picked up a lot of debris and was moving across a field towards the road in front of me. I stopped to let pass ahead of me. Didn’t look dangerous and it was cool to see. 
- We passed a cotton field today. It’s the first one we’ve seen. We’ve seen a lot of corn fields and a lot of fields which (we learned yesterday) contain sorghum. There are also many fields growing crops that we collectively cannot identify.
- Entering Newton there was a Transamerica bicycle route sign and a message welcoming cyclists. It’s the first we’ve seen! 

#### Lowlights
- I was chased by a dog at one point. It was cute and fluffy. It didn’t seem aggressive, just curious, but it still scared me. I yelled at the dog and it left me alone. Then I felt bad for yelling. 
- The roadkill we passed today included what looked like a baby owl.
