We had a slightly longer than expected ride today to Falls of Rough. There was a detour due to a road closure that added about 7 miles. We’re spending the night in a rustic cabin alongside a river that we found on AirBnB. It does not have WiFi and mostly doesn’t have cell service. Every now and then we’ll get a bar of service and a notification will come through, but mostly nothing. So we can enjoy nature uninterrupted, I assume!

I spent the afternoon sitting on the porch in a wooden rocking chair looking at the river. 

#### Highlights
- all of the dogs that wanted to chase me today weren’t able to get very close, and all the dogs that were close didn’t care about me. At one point I saw a big farm house by the road and thought _it feels like that house should have a dog._ I looked closer and, sure enough, there was an old dog slowly coming down from the porch to bark at us. Well done, old chap. You successfully repelled the interlopers. 
- I saw a bunch of loose chickens. One of them crossed the road in front of me. I wonder why. 

#### Lowlights
- this morning at the church the toilet clogged and overflowed. There was toilet water everywhere and I was mortified. Luckily Mike found a mop, cleaning supplies, and a plunger and took care of everything. I must come across as someone who doesn’t know how to use a mop, because he insisted on doing it himself. That’s love right there. 
- road closure and detour
- it never really warmed up today and it was really misty for most of the day
