We’ve learned there can be a fine line between “bicycle tourist” and “homeless person”. Today we rode 100+ miles to avoid straddling that line. 

Our options were:
1. Ride 100+ miles to get to a town with a hotel with availability
2. Ride less than 100 miles and set up our tents in the town square. Depending on the town, our options for accessing a toilet were: at the hospital, at the community pool which may not be open, or nonexistent. 

We went with option 1. It’s possible later in the trip that we would choose option 2, but for now, I am very glad to have a bed _and_ access to a toilet. 

#### Highlights
- 100 miles! Feeling very proud and accomplished
- perfect weather again
- we made it to Kansas

#### Lowlights
- the only beer available in the grocery store was pathetic. Like, Coors Light and Bud Light and nothing else. We looked up the alcohol laws in Kansas and they are more strict than in Utah. So no beer for us tonight.
