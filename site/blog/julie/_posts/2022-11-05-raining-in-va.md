We had a good ride today, though it rained much of the day. It wasn’t cold so the rain wasn’t too bad. We had an easy ride. Before leaving this morning we looked at the elevation profile and there wasn’t anything noteworthy. No steep climbs or long climbs, just gentle squiggles the whole day. 

Mike and I stopped for lunch in Radford. Virginia Tech had a football game this afternoon and the restaurant we ate at was jumping with people watching the game. After we got to Christiansburg, we went to a space-themed diner/sports bar for dinner. It was also jumping, and it seemed many of the patrons had been at the Virginia Tech game earlier.
