Today we biked from Carson City to Fallen. With Mike driving the van now, we all took advantage of not carrying all of our gear. I am now just carrying: food, water, repair kit, first aid kit, and inclement weather clothing. I am so much faster now!

Today is the most mileage we’ve done yet. For the first time since we started, it is both safe to be outside given the temperature AND safe to breathe the air, because we are now far enough from the wildfires. So glad to be out of California!

We had intended to camp on the county fair grounds tonight, but they have an event going on. Instead, we find ourselves sleeping in a Walmart parking lot. Something I never thought I would do. 

#### Highlights
- Route 50 had a nice, wide shoulder for most of the way
- We mostly went downhill today but it was gentle enough that we couldn’t visibly see it, so it just made me feel like I am speed

#### Lowlights
- Jordan got his second flat tire. Puncture from a thorn. 
- Kelly got her first flat. Puncture from a staple.
