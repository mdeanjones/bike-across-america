We left Vallejo around 8:15 this morning. It started with a long climb on a bike path next to a highway, so not super scenic or enjoyable. But then we had a long, lovely down hill followed by a flat ride through some picturesque olive groves and wineries.

It got a lot hotter (high of 102!) and we had some more climbs. Our last climb included Mike's second flat of the trip, at which point we decided to change our destination for the day, and ended early in Vacaville. 

We checked in to a hotel, then noticed Mike's other tire was also flat (again) so after cleaning up, we walked into the downtown area and Mike bought two new tires. Now he's riding on Schwalbe Marathon's like the rest of us! We also got margaritas. So. A great end to the day.

#### Highlights
- that time we had a really long downhill
- riding through wineries, with rolling hills surrounding us
- ending the day with margaritas and air conditioning

#### Lowlights
- Mike's second flat
- Mike's third flat
- When Jordan pointed out that all the hills we rode today don't even register on the elevation profile on our current set of maps, because the map also includes the Sierra Nevada mountain range. We appear to be headed towards a solid wall. 

#### Julie's food (because one day I'll wonder "what _did_ I eat?")
- Breakfast: Gardein breakfast bowl ("sausage", "egg", and potato)
- First snack: granola bar
- Second snack: guacamole and sourdough bread
- Lunch: nothing (we somehow forgot this, but then had dinner at 4pm. Don't worry, mom!)
- Dinner: vegan tacos and margaritas

#### Stats
- Total distance: 30.92 miles
- Elevation gain: 1634 feet
- Weather: hot and dry, high of 102 degrees fahrenheit
