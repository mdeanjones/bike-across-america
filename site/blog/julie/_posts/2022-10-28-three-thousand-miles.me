According to the tracker Mike created for the website, we’ve hit the 3,000 mile mark. It’s just an estimate based on recommended routing between check-ins, so it likely underrepresents the true distance we’ve traveled. 3,000 miles though!

We had a very nice day today. Easy ride, good scenery, agreeable weather. Mike and I stopped for groceries and lunch in the town of Loretto, the home of Maker’s Mark whiskey. We went to the local supermarket, the dollar general, and the family dollar in Loretta on the hunt for hummus. No luck. So instead we went to the restaurant in town for lunch. It was called the Cozy Corner and it was packed at lunchtime on a Friday. 

Mike and I are staying at a really nice BnB outside of Springfield called the Wildflower Ranch Inn. It’s run by two artists from California. They have the BnB in the main house and turned the pool house into a studio. They have artwork they created hanging throughout. It’s really lovely here. 

#### Highlights
- lunch in a restaurant instead of on the side of the road (even though I only had fries)
