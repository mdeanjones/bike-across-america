Today we had another easy ride. We mostly climbed for 15 miles and then mostly descended for 35 miles. 

Since we had some extra time, Mike and I explored the towns we were in a bit. We stopped this morning in Ridgeway for coffee and walked part of the Main Street. It had a thoroughly old-timey Western vibe to it. 

After we got to Montrose, where we are spending the night at an RV park, we stopped at a grocery store and then went to get tacos and margaritas for lunch. We checked in at the RV park, showered, hand-washed some clothes that were _covered_ in mud from riding in the rain without fenders, and then walked to a local craft brewery. An enjoyable, productive day. 

#### Highlights
- “Gun toting vegan tacos” with walnut chorizo
