We decided to take a day off today in Cedar City. We were all wiped from the strong headwinds yesterday and the forecast called for even stronger headwinds today, so we decided to rest and tackle the 5,000+ foot climb tomorrow. 

Mike and I drove up the mountain and check out the riding conditions and scope out places to spend the night. We’ve arrived _right_ when the campsites are closing in the area. One had their last night last night, and the other has their last night tomorrow night. So thankfully we _should_ be able to stay there tomorrow. 

Mike and I went to a local coffee shop for lunch and walked around briefly. Then Mike went with Kelly and Jordan to a wine bar and then a local brewery while I stayed at the hotel and read. It was a relaxing and enjoyable day for everyone.
