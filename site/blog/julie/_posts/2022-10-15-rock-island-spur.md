Today we rode on the Rock Island Spur, a rail trail that connects to the Katy trail in Windsor, where we are spending the night. It’s an unpaved trail but is suitable for all bike types. 

Mike and I stopped for coffee at the General Store in Chilhowee. Outside there was a loose dog, which made me very nervous as I approached, given all the loose dogs that have chased me this past week. This dog, however, was a very good girl. Her name is Lexie. I know this because every customer who visited the general store chatted with Lexie on their way in.

I chatted with another customer in the General Store. He told me some of the history of the trail and mentioned how much the towns along it enjoy cyclists coming through. He asked where the weirdest people I’ve encountered were from (and hoped it wasn’t Missouri). I told him we haven’t really encountered “weird” people but the people of Utah seemed the most okay with vehicular manslaughter, so they aren’t my favorite. I also mentioned the loose dogs that have been chasing us recently. He said he has some hound dogs he uses to hunt coyotes, and sometimes he uses them for that on the trail, and it has really concerned some cyclists. I can imagine! If I was cycling and there was a coyote _and also_ loose dogs chasing the coyote (hopefully), I’d be pretty freaked out.  

Mike and I stopped for lunch at a picnic table at one of the trailheads. Three women who were also riding the trail started talking to us. They just rode the Katy trail with a couple other women and were now doing the Rock Island Spur. They were from all over the country and met through a Facebook group for woman older than 60 who cycle. What a neat idea. I told my mom about the group because these seemed like _exactly_ the kind of people she’d want to hang out with. And she too is a woman over 60 who cycles.  

Mike and I walked around Windsor tonight. It’s a very cute town with a Main Street and a historic caboose train car. I read a _very_ wholesome story about the caboose on the website for the town’s chamber of commerce and wanted to see it in person. 

Tomorrow we will be on the Katy trail all day. 

#### Highlights
- we met some really lovely people today. Fellow cyclists, a customer at the General Store in Chilhowee, the woman running the motel we’re staying at tonight. Outside of Northern Virginia people are just _way_ more friendly. 
- great trail

#### Lowlights
- I was chased by a dog again today. This dog popped out of nowhere while I was on the trail and chased after me while barking. I was able to outrun it and it eventually gave up and turned around to go home. At this point the dog encountered Mike and could not have cared less about him. How rude! He was on a bicycle too!
