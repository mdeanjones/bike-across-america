Today was a great day! It was challenging, but in a good way. It made me feel awesome. And strong. Unlike how the last two challenging days with a headwind made me feel (sad and weak).

We crossed the Ohio River from Illinois to Kentucky. Our penultimate state! We crossed the river by a free ferry operated by the Kentucky department of transportation. A man on the ferry rolled down his window and asked where we were from. I answered him and told him what we were doing. He said we were a glutton for punishment. Sounds about right.  

We had lots of hills today, and I think it is representative of what the rest of our trip across Kentucky will be like. It’s amazing to me that yesterday morning we were riding through flat fields that felt endless, and all day today it was really hilly and forested. This time of year is great for cycling through the forests, with all of the trees changing colors. Picture perfect autumnal landscape. 
 

#### Highlights
- I loved seeing all the trees in their fall colors. 
- The ferry ride was neat. Super laid back. Unlike any ferry I’ve been on before. There’s no time table. They just, go back and forth, taking whoever is around.  
- We are now back on the TransAmerica route, after our Katy trail detour in Missouri. I’m so glad to be back to using paper maps to navigate instead of my phone. I hated having to look at a screen constantly while riding. 

#### Lowlights
- Some of the hills were _almost_ too steep. Any steeper and I would have been walking. So maybe it’s a highlight that I could ride all the hills?
