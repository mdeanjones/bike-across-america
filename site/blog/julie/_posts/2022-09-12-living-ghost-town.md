Today we biked from Middlegate Station to Austin, Nevada. We spent the whole day on Route 50, of course. 

Upon entering Austin I saw a sign that boasted they’ve been social distancing since 1862.  This is considered a “living ghost town.”

The ride was beautiful and overall pretty easy. Distances are deceptive here. I’ll see something in this distance but then it will take like 10 miles before I actually get there. 

During a snack stop, Mike and I saw some fighter jets fly by. It was pretty neat. I guess that’s what the Navy is doing out here. Flying.

Tonight we’re camping in our van in the parking lot of a church. We each had a warm shower and did laundry in the sink. Our clean clothes are now strung up throughout the van and hanging off bicycles, panniers, and across a line hung between two trees. I washed _all_ of my clothes so I’m wearing Mike’s clothes now. _Really_ hoping something of mine is dry tomorrow morning.
