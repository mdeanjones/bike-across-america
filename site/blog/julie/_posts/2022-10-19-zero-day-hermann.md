We took the day off today in Hermann. I lounged around all morning reading and we had breakfast delivered. 

In the afternoon we went to Stone Hill winery for a wine tasting. This winery claims to be the oldest winery in the United States. During prohibition they grew mushrooms in their cellars. Afterwards we walked to the Inn affiliated with the cottage we’re staying at. They have a margarita bar, which we indulged in. They even had small bottles of sparkling wine to add to the margaritas. We very much enjoyed it. 

We got a ride to and from town with Debbie, a local woman running her own taxi service. There’s no Uber or Lyft here. Just Debbie. And she gets paid in cash. Seems like a profitable corner of the market.  

After returning to our cottage we used the hot tub on the balcony. I think we have to ride our bicycles again tomorrow?!
