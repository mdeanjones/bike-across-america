title: Back to services
---

Today we rode to Blanding, a dry town in Utah. Last night _should_ be the last time we’re forced to wild camp or boondock, as we should have reasonable distances between services for the rest of the trip. 

I didn’t really sleep last night (mostly thinking about all the things in the desert that could kill me and _what was that sound?!_), so the ride today was a bit of a struggle for me. 

I was very happy to get to Blanding, where we went to the grocery store, showered, AND did laundry. Living the life. 

We’re planning to ride 75 miles tomorrow and enter into Colorado!
