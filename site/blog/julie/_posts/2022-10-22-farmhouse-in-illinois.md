We are spending the night in a farm house outside of Vergennes, Illinois. We found it on AirBnB. It’s super cute! 

We had a challenging day getting here, due to a persistent headwind. Mike and I left earlier than usual this morning because the wind was forecasted to pick up throughout the day. We had roughly 15 miles without much of a headwind, but the last 47 miles were a real slog. 

Apart from the wind it was a good ride: well-paved roads, nice scenery of fields and interspersed with residential neighborhoods, courteous drivers. 

I spent the whole afternoon looking at the maps for the remainder of our ride and planning out possible stops. It looks like we’ll be spending several nights in “cyclist-only accommodation” provided by churches. If we follow the possible itinerary exactly (which I doubt we will), we’ll be in Yorktown, Virginia on 12 November. Just three weeks away!

#### Highlights
- lovely AirBnB
- a couple dogs obviously considered chasing me, but then saw how slow I was going with the headwind and gave up. They saw me coming and ran towards me barking, but then I was still really far away and they appeared to not want to run so far to get to me, so they waited in the road for me, but by the time I reached them they had lost interest. 

#### Lowlights
- strong, persistent headwind
