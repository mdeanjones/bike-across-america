Today we decided to celebrate our successful climb of our first mountain range by taking a day off in South Lake Tahoe.

Mike has decided to be the driver of our (emotional) support vehicle for the next leg of our journey, so we spent part of the day figuring out the logistics for that. He's going to rent a campervan and be our SAG wagon from here until we get to Pueblo, Colorado.

Mike and I rode to the state line with Nevada, so he biked across the width of California.

We picked up a rental car this afternoon. We couldn't get one for a one-way journey, so early tomorrow morning Mike, Jordan, and I are going to drive to San Francisco and Mike will pick up a camper van and Jordan and I will drive back to South Lake Tahoe and then bike with Kelly to Carson City. You might remember San Francisco. It's the place we left 8 days ago and have been traveling away from every day. But don't worry, we can drive there and back in a day with enough time to get a bike ride in. 

#### Highlights
- We got to sleep in
- We got to ride our bikes without any bags

#### Lowlights
- I watched a cyclist get hit by a car. He seemed to be okay, and I watched him get up and pick up the pieces of his bicycle, but it was still unsettling to watch.

#### Julie's food
- Breakfast: breakfast baps with "sausage"
- Lunch: tempeh burger on a bagel from Sprouts (at the recommendation of a cyclist we met in Sacramento)
- Dinner: leftover breakfast burrito

#### Stats
- Total distance: 0 miles*
- Elevation gain: 0 feet
- Weather: hot and dry, high of 86 degrees Fahrenheit, with lots of smoke from a wildfire west of here
