We made it to South Lake Tahoe!  This is a huge milestone because it means we've conquered the Sierra Nevada Mountains and proven we have what it takes to actually cross the country.  As always, the issue that hangs over our head is time.  Our finish no later than date is 3 December.  That means here on out we need to average 40 miles a day to reach that goal.  Crossing the country should be achievable in the time we have left, even with taking a day or two off.

Tomorrow we're taking a well deserved zero day and hanging in Tahoe to recover and enjoy the lake.  We'll also use that time to startegize our next challenge: crossing the Nevada and Utah desert.

So far, South Lake Tahoe is super nice.  It reminds me a bit of Lake Annecy in the French Alps, but with better beer.  We actually had Pliny the Elder on tap- doesn't get much better!
