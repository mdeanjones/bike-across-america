Today, we biked more than 100 miles from Eads, Colorado to Scott City, Kansas.  This marks our longest biking day of the trip as well as mine and Jordan's longest day of biking ever!  We've done metric centuries (just over 60 miles) several times before, but this feels like a challenge from a different league for sure.  We decided to go for the century for two mains reasons: 1) if we're ever going to do it, flat Kansas seems like the best place and 2) there honestly wasn't a good place to spend the night between Eads and Scott City.  So I must say this milestone was born out of necessity.  The hope is that we won't be too sore tomorrow to do the relatively short ride (just over 50 miles) we've got planned.  I'm grateful that the the very cozy Airbnb we're staying at tonight has a batch of cinnamon rolls for us to enjoy in the morning.  That'll help get me going for sure.

As for other benchmarks reached today, we checked off a new state and a new time zone.  The border between Colorado and Kansas marked the beginning of central time.  Only one more time change ahead! 

Lastly, we're basically at the halfway point of the trip.  On one hand, it's hard to believe we've reached this point and have already biked more than 1,800 miles.  On the other hand, my legs, hands, and butt feel the pain of every one of those miles so I can totally believe it.  Hopefully, I won't turn into a stiff, barely functional, old woman before we reach the end!
