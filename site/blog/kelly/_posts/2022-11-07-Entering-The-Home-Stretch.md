As of this morning, we have 310 miles to go!  It is so surreal to be in the final stage of this adventure.  If everything goes according to plan, we'll arrive in Williamsburg Friday afternoon and then bike out to the Yorktown coast Saturday morning.  When we're done biking, it's back to DC and back to reality.  Not sure if I know how to do anything other than bike touring at this point.

The plan for today is to bike from Troutville to Vesuvius, a small at the base of the Blue Ridge Parkway.  This will set us up for the final climb of the trip.  We'll go up and over the mountains to finish the day in Charlottesville.  After that, the route is pretty much all downhill to the coast.

As for the weather, the last few days has been a bit of a challenge.  It has rained quite a bit and the mornings have been pretty foggy.  We've also been contending with the time change which has forced us to get earlier starts to maximize the daylight. Virginia is forecasted to get hit next week with rain from the topical system brewing off of Florida- very glad we should be done by then!
