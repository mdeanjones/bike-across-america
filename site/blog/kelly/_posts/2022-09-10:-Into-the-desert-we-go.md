Goodbye California, hello Nevada!

As we were leaving Tahoe, a new wildfire broke out nearby called the Mosquito fire.  It was big, and is continuing to grow and burn an area already scorched from previous fires this season.  It caused the air to be quite smoky, making 3pm feel more like late evening.  The air quality was terrible and I could occasionally see ash floating down from the sky.  Despite the beauty of Lake Tahoe and the charm of the town of South Lake Tahoe, I'm glad to be moving on.

As we left South Lake Tahoe on our way to Carson City, Nevada, we had one last small climb in the Sierras followed by a more than 10 mile downhill.  Though I'm always a fan of a downhill, the amount of traffic and skinny shoulder made me a bit nervous.  Nevertheless, the views were gorgeous.  With the Sierra Nevada Mountains at our backs, we could look out over the vastness of the shrubby, dry Nevada desert.

It will take us several days to cross Nevada into Utah.  There will not be many services (shops, restaurants, gas stations, etc) to stop at along the way.  Thankfully, Mike has graciously taken on the role of support vehicle to me, Jordan, and Julie.  He rented a kickass camper van that is now well-stocked with food and water to ensure we make it across the desert safely.  Mike already has my vote for MVP of this whole adventure!
