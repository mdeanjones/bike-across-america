Crossing the state of Nevada has been a surprise and learning experience on many levels.  The first, and most important, is the shocking beauty and vastness of the landscape.  Between stark mountain ranges, these wide, flat basins stretch on for miles and miles.  It's almost impossible to judge distance because you can look out so far ahead.  What starts as a tiny dot moving in the distance turns into a semi-truck miles later.  It's both unsettling and freeing to be cruising through such an open area.

The weather has also been a big surprise.  I was expecting dry heat given that we're in a desert climate.  Instead, given the time of year, we've had cool nights (lower 50s) and two days of rain.  It is both beautiful and terrifying to watch the storms and rains brew off in the distance, knowing that miles down the road and hour(s) later you'll eventually run into that wall of water.  My dad, who had a slight obsession with all things weather and meteorology-related, would have been fascinated.

The other discovery on this leg of the trip has been just how far I can bike in a day and how deep I can push to reach my goals.  Yesterday, we biked 65 miles, today we did 70, and tomorrow we're gonna push 80.  I'm certainly tired and sore at the end of these rides, but I've been pleasantly surprised at how I'm able to wake up (usually before dawn) and do it all over again the next day.
